    <h4>AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION.</h4>
    <hr class="quarter" />
    <p>This Number of the Missionary will reach our friends, the pastors and the
    churches, about the first of June, one month before the usual vacation time sends
    many of the pastors to their much-needed summer rest, and when the churches enter
    upon the months of small congregations. We wish to remind our friends that the
    expenditures of a missionary society have no vacation, and to ask them that in this
    remaining month, special efforts be made to prepare us for the months when there is
    the usual outflow with only a small stream coming in.</p>
    <p>The showing of our receipts is favorable. For the seven months to April 30th, they
    aggregate $158,921.20, an increase of $5,082.75 over last year. The increase in
    collections and donations is $9,241.84, but there is a decrease in legacies of
    $4,159.09, leaving the net increase as above stated. On the other hand, however, the
    expenditure that has been absolutely demanded by our growing work has been $23,778.24
    over the receipts. Our committee has denied many appeals pressed upon it, from the
    workers in the field, for needed growth and strengthening; but some calls have come
    with such urgency to save the work already in hand, that it felt constrained to grant
    the additional appropriations, and we are very confident that if our constituents had
    been present, they, too, would have concurred heartily and unanimously in the
    votes.</p>
    <p>We might reasonably hope that this debtor balance would be wiped out during the
    five months of our fiscal year yet before us, but there is a special reason for
    anxiety that it should soon be materially reduced. It is at this time that we are
    compelled to plan the work, and make estimates, for the next fiscal year, beginning
    October 1st. We are now endeavoring to cut down these estimates to the lowest
    possible point, but if, before the close of June, there shall be no marked reduction
    of this balance, we shall be obliged to cut still further, even to the arresting or
    crippling of work already begun. We ask our friends to rally to the rescue.</p>

    <h3>A NOBLE WORD FROM THE OHIO CONGREGATIONAL ASSOCIATION.</h3>
    <h4>REPORT ON THE A.M.A. BY REV. WASHINGTON GLADDEN, D.D.</h4>
    <p>The work of the American Missionary Association appeals to the churches of Ohio
    with cumulative urgency. "A.M.A.," as our stalwart brother Pike used to say, are
    letters that stand for the darkened races of this continent&mdash;the American, the
    Mongolian and the African. To the Christian people of America, these tribes are
    entrusted; for their enlightenment and Christianization, we are responsible. The
    Government at Washington can do something toward protecting these people in their
    political rights; but there is very little, after all, that can be done for any
    people which does not know how to assert and maintain its own rights. Liberty can
    never be a gratuity, it must always be an achievement. Peoples, as well as
    individuals, must work out their own salvation. The Negro at the South is cheated out
    of his political rights, simply because he does not know how to claim them; the
    Indian on the plains is defrauded of his property, because he does not know how to
    protect himself. No matter how favorable the laws may be to these hapless people,
    they will be oppressed and impoverished and kept in a condition of semi-slavery,
    unless they know how to use the laws in their own advantage. Education, therefore, is
    the only effectual remedy for their wrongs. To awaken their minds, to arouse the
    energies of hope, to show them that they are made in God's image and that they have a
    right to all the liberties of the laws of God, is the only way to complete and secure
    their emancipation from bondage and from barbarism.</p>
    <p>This is the work to which the American Missionary Association calls us all. It is
    our just pride as Congregationalists that through this Association more has been done
    for the true enfranchisement of the freedmen than through any other agency, and it is
    our duty to see that this great work, in which we have borne so large and honorable a
    part, halt not nor slacken in its energy because of our failure to keep its treasury
    replenished and its faithful laborers re-enforced and supported by our gifts and our
    prayers.</p>
    <hr />
    <a name="editorial3" id="editorial3"></a>
    <h3>FACTS AND FIGURES.</h3>
    <p>The sum total of all the contributions of all the benevolent agencies for the
    evangelization and education of the Negro in the South, is seventeen cents per year
    for each person.</p>
    <p>This seventeen cents includes whatever is done in missionary colleges and in all
    educational missions, as well as in the direct church work.</p>
    <p>In twenty-one years from 1841 to 1861 there were twenty-one crops of cotton raised
    by slave labor, which aggregated 58,441,906 bales.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>{149}</span>
    <p>In the twenty-one years from 1865 to 1885 there were twenty-one crops of cotton
    which aggregated 93,389,031 bales.</p>
    <p>That is, by free labor there was an excess over the productions of slave labor of
    34,947,125 bales, or nearly 35,000,000 bales. The value of 35,000,000 bales of cotton
    produced by free labor in excess of the product of slave labor cannot have been less
    than $2,000,000,000, or about the full valuation of all the slaves who were made free
    by the war, had they been sold at the ruling prices. The gain is due not only to the
    emancipation of the blacks, but to the emancipation of the whites from enforced
    idleness.</p>
    <p>The cotton factories of the world annually require about 12,000,000 bales of
    cotton, American weight. Good land in Texas produces one bale to the acre. The
    world's supply of cotton could be grown on less than 19,000 square miles, or upon an
    area equal to only seven per cent. of the area of Texas.</p>
    <hr />
    <a name="editorial4" id="editorial4"></a>
    <h3>THE COLOR-LINE QUESTION: WHAT IS IT?</h3>
    <p>1. It is not the question of <i>social</i> equality. No one doubts the right of
    individuals, or the family, or the social circle, to draw their lines of association
    and fellowship at their own pleasure, whether at wealth, rank, fashion, talent, or
    anything else. To confound this with the real question, is not candid.</p>
    <p>2. Still less is it the question of the inter-marriage of the races. Here,
    individual preference is undeniable. To claim that this is the question, and to ask
    tauntingly: "Do you want your daughter to marry a <i>nigger</i>?" is ungentlemanly
    and unworthy of an answer.</p>
    <p>3. The question is: Shall a line be drawn between the white and black races,
    giving rights and privileges in Church and State to the one race, which are denied to
    the other, solely because of race or color? In other words: Shall a line be drawn
    which shall separate the Negroes, and assign them as a race to the position of
    inferiors irrespective of merit or character, and merely on the ground of race or
    color?</p>
    <p>To narrow the discussion, we leave out of view the civil or political aspect of
    the question and confine ourselves to the religious, and we propose to give a few
    illustrations. A Negro in every way qualified, in character, piety, and intelligence,
    applies for membership in a white church. Shall the color-line be drawn and he be
    refused admission for no other reason than that he is a Negro? This does not imply
    that the whites and blacks should be urged or persuaded to unite in all churches or
    in any church. It may be conceded that the blacks generally do not desire to unite
    with white churches, and that, in their present state of culture, it may not always
    be for their edification to do so. But where an individual Negro <i>does</i> believe
    that it would be for his edification and growth in grace to belong to a white church,
    shall the color that God stamped on him, or the race in which God gave him his birth,
    be a sufficient reason <span class="pagenum"><a name="page150"
    id="page150"></a>{150}</span> for refusing him? The question and the principle apply
    equally if the Negro should be given to understand that while he would not actually
    be refused admission, yet the preference of the church would be that he should not
    apply; nay, we do not see why the principle is not the same if the well-known
    attitude of the church on the race question should be such that the Christian
    self-respect of the Negro would not allow him to make the application.</p>
    <p>Again, shall colored churches, conferences or presbyteries be formed on the same
    territory <i>in order that</i> the colored members may not unite with the white
    churches, conferences or presbyteries? Shall a line be run between the races on the
    simple ground of race or color, and irrespective of character, convenience or choice,
    so that the Negro as a church member shall not be allowed to choose the church he
    shall join, or as a minister the option as to his conference or presbytery? For one
    race to demand such a line of separation, is to consign the other race to a position
    of inferiority as humiliating as it is discouraging. Such is the demand of race
    prejudice, and such the position of inferiority in which it insists on placing the
    Negro. Slavery held the Negro there, and since emancipation, this race-separation is
    intended to accomplish the same purpose. The Southern white man makes no objection to
    the race or color of the Negro, but only to his position as an equal. He was not
    merely tolerated, he was more than tolerated, as a slave, and he is now as a
    servant.</p>
    <p>The present controversy in regard to the color-line is calling forth some frank
    admissions from intelligent white men at the South. Thus the Rev. Wm. H. Campbell, an
    Episcopal clergyman of South Carolina, vindicates his refusal to sit in Convention
    with the Negroes by the inferiority which the Almighty has stamped upon them. Mr.
    Campbell says:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"The Bishop does not understand or appreciate the reasons why some of us cannot,
      under any circumstances, sit in Convention with Negroes. The objections commonly
      made need not here be referred to. The difficulty with some of us is not 'on
      account of color,' as it is usually, but not with strict accuracy, put; for some
      Negroes are as white as some white men, but because they are of an inferior race,
      so made by the Almighty and never intended by him to be put on an equality with the
      white race, in either Church or State."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The question at issue is not one of expediency, but of principle; and, among
    Christians, whether in the individual church or the ecclesiastical body, it is a
    question of Christian duty to be settled by the Divine authority of the Master
    himself. We propose no argument on the subject, but content ourselves by quoting a
    few well-known passages of Scripture, which, though familiar, have lost neither their
    significancy nor their authority. In the end, the voice of God must be decisive.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of
      the earth."</p>
      <p>"God hath showed me that I should call no man common or unclean."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>{151}</span>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons, but in every nation,
      he that feareth Him and worketh righteousness is accepted with Him."</p>
      <p>"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is
      neither male nor female, for ye are all one in Christ."</p>
      <p>"Inasmuch as ye have not done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren, ye
      have not done it unto me."</p>

    <p>Secretary Roy, in the <i>Advance</i>, controverts the statement of the <i>Herald
    and Presbyter</i>, that the Congregationalists have come to consent to separate
    ecclesiastical bodies on the ground of color. Dr. Roy supposes that this conclusion
    may have been jumped at because of the formation of a new Congregational Association
    in Georgia, which is an outcome from the Congregational Methodist churches there. The
    <i>Interior</i>, evidently with gladness, makes the same assertion. The <i>Christian
    Union</i> replies to this, saying, "We do not think this is true; <i>but, if it is,
    so much the worse for the Congregationalists!</i>" We may say with Dr. Roy, that
    nothing is more certain than that in the New Empire that is growing before our eyes,
    the Congregational churches of this century will not turn towards the dark ages, and
    will not put themselves to shame by refusing to fellowship with the disciples of
    Christ on the ground of caste. Such a proposition would have the scorn of our
    National Council.</p>
    <p>The Christianity of our churches will not fall behind the humanity of Victor Hugo,
    who said, "I have had in my hand the gloved and white palm of the upper class and the
    heavy black hand of the lower class, and have recognized that both are the hands of
    man."</p>
    <p>The Congregational churches may not be quoted as countenancing this great
    wickedness against God and man.</p>

    <h3>FROM ADDRESS OF REV. E.T. FLEMING OF GEORGIA, IN THE BROADWAY TABERNACLE OF NEW
    YORK.</h3>
    <p>"I suppose it will be necessary to tell you that I am a Negro, that I was born a
    slave. We are struggling against difficulties. We meet with a great deal of
    opposition. A case comes to mind which shows something of this opposition. I went out
    into what we call the Bottom District. The church there was dirty. I went to work and
    got a sufficient amount of money to buy a barrel of lime. It took me a week to get
    enough money to buy a barrel of lime. Another brother and myself got the barrel of
    lime there on a wheel-barrow. We whitewashed the church inside and out, and finished
    the job about half-past eleven o'clock. It was too late to return to the city, and we
    agreed to sleep in the church. The next morning, I was surprised to hear a great
    noise on the outside, and opening the door, looked out and saw a lean, lank, white
    woman. She was calling to her daughter, "Louisa, Louisa, come here." Her daughter
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>{152}</span> came to her
    mother and said, "My &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, they have painted the nigger
    church white. We must put a stop to that." They said we would have to move the
    church, on the ground that they were not going to stand anything of that kind. These
    are the things that meet us in opposition there. I was myself refused admittance to a
    Gospel Tent where a distinguished evangelist from the North was preaching."</p>

    <h3>A STRIKING STATEMENT.</h3>
    <p>In one of the hotels in Columbia, South Carolina, among the collections of an
    excellent library, is a book which bears the seal of the State of South Carolina,
    giving much statistical information as to the geological character of the State, its
    agricultural resources, its mineral products and the peculiarities of its population.
    From its pages, the following extract is taken, which is reproduced here for its
    suggestiveness. It seems incredible, and yet the authority is wholly Southern and has
    the imprint of the State. It is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"No effort adequate to even an approximate determination statistically of the
      intermixture of the White and Negro races has as yet been undertaken. Mr.
      Patterson, quoted in an authoritative work upon '<i>The Resources and Population of
      South Carolina</i>,' and published by the <i>State Board of Agriculture</i> in
      1883, as one who has given much attention to the subject, says, even now there are
      no longer Negroes. One-third has a large infusion of white blood, another third has
      less, but still some, and of the other third it would be difficult to find an
      assured specimen of pure African blood. This, continues the report, is a startling
      statement; but in the absence of statistics, whoever puts it to the test among his
      Negro acquaintance will be surprised at the degree in which it conforms to the
      facts. If the lineage of those Negroes whose color and features seem most
      unmistakably to mark them as of purely African descent, be traced, indubitable
      evidence may often be obtained of white parentage more or less remote."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>MISAPPLIED BENEFACTIONS.</h3>
    <p>The judicious placing of benefaction is a large part of the good of it. Is it
    wisely located? Will it be permanent? Will it be reproductive? Will it be in the
    hands of persons suitably responsible for the administration of it? Will it be under
    a fitting supervision? The cause appeals to sympathy; does it also carry the mark of
    good judgment? For lack of this double endorsement, not a little of generous giving
    is thrown away. It is a fine piece of romance; does it proffer a sufficient security
    upon the proffered investment of the Lord's money?</p>
    <p>A worthy Christian woman brings the scheme. It is laid upon the mountains of East
    Tennessee, thrust up into notoriety by the writing of Charles Egbert Craddock. A lady
    of faith and hope and energy, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"
    id="page153"></a>{153}</span> proposes to build up an industrial farm-school of high
    quality for the neglected girls of that mountain district. She has already been
    teaching a common-school among them. She comes up to a city of New England. She lays
    her plan before some of the noble women there. They take it up without further
    inquiry as to the feasibility of the undertaking. With their first contributions an
    old worn-out farm is bought in the lady's name, and in the cheap farm-house a small
    school is opened. The location is in an out-of-the-way neighborhood, three or four
    miles from the little, old, tumble-down county seat. Now a fine building is to be
    secured. The lady patrons raise their offerings up to six thousand dollars. Fine
    architectural plans are devised at the North. Meantime, speculators on the ground,
    who for a few cents an acre have bought up a great quantity of land adjoining and
    would be glad to sell it at a dollar an acre, have donated a hundred acres, more or
    less, to the school. On this tract the building is located and goes forward. The
    frame is put up and pretty much enclosed. For want of money the enterprise comes to a
    stand, and now for these four years the stranded structure has been taking damage
    from the storms.</p>
    <p>The place has been visited repeatedly by the superintendents of the A.M.A., to
    find the state of the case and to see if anything could be done to utilize the
    partial plant. The pastor of the lady donors became interested to save the investment
    through the A.M.A., or to stop the pouring of more funds into the venture, but after
    all his correspondence and personal conference, he found that, if the whole property
    were to be offered to the Association, it could not afford to accept it and undertake
    to carry forward the school. It already has a prosperous academy in that county and
    another in an adjoining county, and these, wisely located in congenial communities,
    are all that is needed for those and for contiguous counties. There is no way to
    utilize it, Alas, "Wherefore this waste?"</p>
    <p>An Orphanage for colored children is a tempting charity. The A.M.A early undertook
    such work. At Wilmington, N.C., and at Atlanta, Ga., it bought lands and erected
    ample buildings, but the experiment satisfied the authorities that the Association
    was not called to that department of work. The children's god-fathers and
    god-mothers, in devotion to their covenant, or grand-parents from personal interest,
    would soon be taking them out, and others having care of them would call them out as
    soon as, by some growth and training, the scholars were made profitable for work, and
    so those properties were sold and the avails put into the ordinary educational
    process. Then the conclusion was reached that this was the obligation of the local
    communities, and <i>not of foreign charity</i>. According to this idea, an Orphanage
    in a Southern city, undertaken not by the patronage or approval of the A.M.A., though
    made to appear so because the originator had been under its commission there as a
    missionary, has been transferred to a local board and to the support of the city
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>{154}</span> and county.
    That is as it should be. Those local authorities ought to take care of their own
    orphans, and not appeal to the charity of the North to relieve them of their proper
    burdens of humanity.</p>
    <p>Another so-called Orphanage at still another Southern city, started as an
    individual venture. It was allowed for a short time to have a conditional endorsement
    from the A.M.A., which was soon withdrawn and the enterprise disowned. This has
    swallowed up thousands of dollars of the money of benevolence, and yet it has all the
    time been a sham and a falsehood. There was nothing of it. When a lady newspaper
    correspondent called to visit the institution, ten or a dozen children from a
    neighboring private school were borrowed and paraded as orphans, when at the time
    there were only two little children in the concern, and they had grandparents living
    near and abundantly able to take care of them. "Wherefore this waste?"</p>
    <p>In yet another Southern city, a couple of young ladies start a school. Having once
    been under commission of the A.M.A., in connection with its institutions, they appear
    to many to have its endorsement and they make appeal to its constituents. Money comes
    along for a work irresponsibly begun and without supervision. Only a year goes by
    before they appeal by their leaflet-paper for several thousand dollars to buy land
    and build a home and school property. Who but they shall hold and own the property?
    Whose shall it be when they marry or grow weary of the work and leave? What
    protection is there for such misplaced benefaction?</p>
    <p>By no means would the Association seek to interfere with donations to individuals
    where the donors investigate for themselves and assume the responsibility, but it is
    not fair that we should be held as apparently responsible for movements that we
    disown, and it is not fair to our constituents that we should allow them to remain
    under the impression that in giving to irresponsible projects, they are favoring such
    as are endorsed by us.</p>
    <p>Thirty-five years ago the Congregational Union was initiated in the Albany
    Convention on purpose to protect Eastern friends from the miscellaneous and
    irresponsible and persistent solicitation for individual church enterprise. It is the
    business of that Society to receive, inspect and decide upon all such applications.
    Take it away and the flood gates would be lifted again. No less in the cause of
    missionary education is such discretionary service needed.</p>

    <h3>THE NEGRO QUESTION.</h3>
    <p>This is the title of a recent brochure by George W. Cable, published by the
    American Missionary Association. With the most vigorous and courageous devotion to
    the question that "is the gravest in American affairs," Mr. Cable addresses himself
    to the problem and to the answer that should be made to it. His apprehension of
    injustice is so keen and true, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"
    id="page155"></a>{155}</span> and his seriousness, in view of the weariness and
    offence that the whole subject gives to a great majority of the people, is so urgent,
    that the paper has been criticized as pessimistic, and as an impatient cry against
    evils that are speedily being rectified. We may say that the optimistic view of evils
    never did much to correct them, and that those who are patient with wrongs will never
    create a sentiment against them. To us, this seems the voice of a prophet pleading
    for righteousness to man and righteousness in the land.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>OUR WHOLE COUNTRY.</h3>
    <p>Among the recent issues of the press, none has been more effective and deservedly
    popular than the pamphlet entitled, "OUR COUNTRY," written by our esteemed friend,
    Rev. Josiah Strong, D.D. It has aroused public attention in a remarkable degree, and
    has opened the way for a career of most promising usefulness to the author.</p>
    <p>Our only regret in reading these stirring pages, has arisen from the fact, that in
    its survey it leaves almost entirely out of account nearly one third part of our
    country, namely, the South, a part, too, that contains as many elements of future
    trouble to the nation, and elements, too, that if properly dealt with, can minister
    as largely to the nation's future prosperity, as any other portion. Our object in
    penning this item is to suggest that some man of equal diligence in collecting facts,
    and of equal skill in handling them, shall write a book entitled, "Our <i>Whole</i>
    Country," that shall omit no part of it.</p>

    <h3>IN MEMORIAM.</h3>
    <p>Another good man has gone to his reward. Rev. Geo. J. Tillotson, who has

    his home in Wethersfield, Conn. His useful life was spent in that State. He was born
    in Farmington, Feb. 5, 1805, was graduated at Yale in 1825, studied theology in the
    Yale Seminary one year and at Andover for two years, completing his theological
    studies in 1830. He had several long pastorates, which he filled with great fidelity
    and success. From 1876 he was not employed as a pastor, but devoted himself with
    great assiduity to various modes of promoting the Redeemer's kingdom. He had
    practised economy and had the means to give, and this he did with a discriminating,
    and yet a liberal, hand. To the founding of the Tillotson Institute, he gave not only
    from his own resources, but devoted his time and energies to collecting funds from
    his friends. But his benefactions were not confined to one object; he had a broad
    sympathy for every good cause. He was a man of genial temperament, and closed his
    useful career after a short illness in the 84th year of his age.</p>

    <h3>THE RADICAL FORCES OF CHRISTIANITY, AS EXHIBITED IN THE WORK OF THE AMERICAN
    MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION.</h3>
    <p>BY REV. J.W. COOPER, D.D.</p>
    <p>The work of Christ is the work of Christianity. By the "radical forces of
    Christianity," we mean the simple spirit of the Master, in its original and energetic
    operation. We are dealing with no abstractions, neither are we considering the
    operation of human agencies. What Christ was in his earthly ministry, that
    Christianity is, because of His living presence <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page157" id="page157"></a>{157}</span> in the church to-day. Wherever we
    discover the working of those principles which were exemplified in his life, there He
    is present in living power, the inspirer of the endeavor, and the strength of it. The
    claim that the work of the American Missionary Association makes upon our attention,
    may be presented in a variety of forms. Its work is commended to us, for example,
    because it is patriotic, that is, it makes its appeal to our self-interest. The
    instinct of self-preservation demands that we sustain it. Four and a half millions of
    Negroes in our Southern States are utterly illiterate. Half that number of Southern
    whites are in the same deplorable condition. These men are citizens. They hold the
    ballot. Our free institutions are not safe in such hands as these. Education is an
    absolute necessity. This wide-spreading and dense ignorance, among masses of free
    American people, must be speedily overcome. We do not wonder, therefore, that Andrew
    D. White in his scholarly address, "The Message of the 19th Century to the 20th,"
    puts the education of the South first among the many great and pressing problems that
    claim the attention of statesmen. It is a matter of self-interest and
    self-preservation.</p>
    <p>This work commends itself, also, because of its justice. It appeals as a duty, to
    every enlightened conscience. The ignorance of the Negro, and the degradation of the
    Indian, are more our fault than theirs. We owe it to them, as a matter of simple
    justice, that we now make reparation, as best we can, for the wrong done to them in
    the past. If we, as a nation, have helped push them down, we ought to help lift them
    up. It is a burden which stern justice lays upon us.</p>
    <p>But I turn from all such impressive arguments as these, to find another and
    altogether different motive to this work, one which the statesman may consider of
    little worth, the appeal of which mere conscience may not feel, but, which to the
    Christian heart must ever be more powerful and persuasive than all other motives that
    can be named. This work commends itself to us, because it is a Christly work. The
    spirit of the Master is in it. The radical forces of Christianity are exemplified by
    it. This Society may stand forth before the world to-day, and without any sacrifice
    of humility or reverence, opening the book and finding the place where it is written,
    it may say, in concert with the Master himself, "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon
    me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor, he hath sent me to
    bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim deliverance to the captives, and the opening
    of the prison to them that are bound, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord
    that He might be glorified." And here is its strongest claim upon our sympathy and
    support.</p>
    <p>That this representation is not an exaggerated one, and that the claim is in no
    way over-stated, we shall see more clearly as the comparison is followed out in
    detail. The work which this Association has in hand will <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page158" id="page158"></a>{158}</span> bear the test of analysis. It is not
    only a Christian work, it is a work which, from the beginning, has called into
    exercise the fundamental principles of Christianity. It exemplifies Christianity in
    its most original and essential features.</p>
    <h4>I.&mdash;A RADICAL FAITH.</h4>
    <p>As I look into this work, the first thing that impresses me is the faith that
    inspired it. It was a most sublime undertaking. It began, so far as relates to its
    present fields of labor, with the millions of freedmen just emancipated from two and
    a half centuries of bondage. What this bondage signified, this present generation
    will find it difficult to realize. For years it had been a crime to teach them the
    alphabet. They had been bought and sold like cattle. Their lives were a daily school
    in sensual immorality, deceit and dishonesty. Every manly aspiration, and womanly
    feeling, was smothered at its birth. They had come from savagery to slavery, and in a
    day, without training or preparation, they were set free. It is no wonder that they
    were ignorant, indolent, degraded and despised. As one of their own number says, "We
    came into bondage naked and destitute of worldly goods, we went out of it penniless,
    homeless and almost characterless." Now it was this mass of degraded humanity that
    this Association set itself to elevate and Christianize, and it did it with a calm
    assurance and serene hope which no obstacle has as yet been able to disturb. The road
    has been a long and hard one, but it did not anticipate an easy time or miraculous
    success. It has met with new and perhaps unexpected difficulties. It may be that all
    the workers would say what the President of Talladega writes in a recent letter, "The
    magnitude of the obstacles are more and more real to me as I live and work." But they
    still live and they still work, never doubting the final result. If you want to find
    men who have undying faith in the future of the black race, go to those who, in the
    spirit of their Master, are toiling night and day, under the commission of this
    Society, for its elevation.</p>
    <p>In the same spirit, also, this Association has welcomed new labors and entered
    into new fields. When Chinamen were to be Christianized, immediately it had great
    faith for the Chinese. When the Indian missions were laid upon it, then it saw
    wonderful possibilities in the red man. And now, last of all, when some million or
    two of long-forgotten and neglected "Mountain Whites" are brought to its attention,
    it sees in these abjectly poor, dispirited and superstitious people, only another
    opportunity for elevating humanity, and proving the power of Christianity to restore
    the lost manhood of every race.</p>
    <p>These servants of God are not engaged in a forlorn hope. They have faith. Wherever
    they work there they expect results, not only in the saving of individual souls, but
    in regenerating whole races of men. A Christian woman, missionary to the poor whites
    among the mountains of East <span class="pagenum"><a name="page159"
    id="page159"></a>{159}</span> Tennessee, under the inspiration of her great faith,
    writes home to her friends, "We can almost hear the bells ring in unreared steeples,
    and hear the songs from choirs that are as yet totally oblivious to the spirit of
    melody, and enter into the heart-worship of the prayer meetings that are to be when
    shall have been fulfilled the prophecy, that 'to the people which sat in darkness and
    the shadow of death, light is sprung up'." Such buoyant, hopeful faith as this, so
    clear and beautiful in its confidence in the promises of God, is one of the "radical
    forces" which command, while they inspire, this holy work.</p>
    <h4>II.&mdash;A RADICAL LOVE.</h4>
    <p>But what may be called the special characteristic of this Society among missionary
    organizations doing work in our own land, that which establishes its special claim
    upon hearts of Christian people, is the radical spirit of love there is in it. It
    exemplifies in a most practical way, the brotherhood of man. It repudiates caste. It
    is absolutely color-blind. It works for the despised. It helps those who are
    themselves the most helpless. This is no newly-discovered fact. I remember the first
    sermon I ever heard in behalf of this work, more than twenty years ago; it was drawn
    from the Parable of the Good Samaritan. The text was, "Who is my neighbor?" The
    address of the honored late President of this Association at the close of the last
    Annual Meeting which he attended, was in the trend of this very same Scripture. "This
    organization," he said, "is the Good Samaritan, loving to bestow its aid upon the
    poorest and most despised, the most severely wounded races of our country." The
    sermon, a score of years ago, told us that our neighbor was the Negro, just then made
    free. So said President Washburn, "If you can point out to this organization any race
    that needs its assistance, whether colored or white, there is the legitimate field of
    this Association."</p>
    <p>It would seem that a law so emphatically taught by Jesus Christ as the common
    brotherhood of man, and so familiar to the world, would long ago have been accepted
    and adopted in the practice of Christian nations, especially by a Christian Republic
    within its own borders. But, instead of that, it is the hardest of all laws for us to
    learn and the most difficult of all to put in operation. Our policy toward the
    general colored races in this land has been one of cold-hearted and cruel
    selfishness. As ex-Senator Brace has said, speaking in behalf of his own people,
    "From the red race was taken their lands, from the yellow their labor, from the black
    their persons. The red race was gradually driven toward a setting sun; the yellow
    race, the rabble demanded to be driven from the country; the black man was a slave in
    chains, with no rights which the Constitution recognized."</p>
    <p>These unjust prejudices are by no means altogether a thing of the past. They are
    not as violent as they once were, thanks to the influence <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page160" id="page160"></a>{160}</span> of this Association, but they still
    exist. "Niggers," are still ordered out of Southern churches. Many a professed
    Christian still wants his Indian "dead." This work has all along been compelled to
    fight its way against suspicion, bigotry and hatred; it must do so still, because it
    recognizes man as man, whether his skin be white or black, red or yellow; and, in
    taking this radical ground, it is interpreting to the world the benevolent spirit of
    the Saviour, and is preparing the way for that universal reign of love on earth which
    He came to establish. Such a work as this is the salvation of our Christianity.
    Without it, one of the chief evidences for Christianity would be taken away, and the
    spirit of it would die. Standing before a congregation of white men, Negroes and
    Indians, with a Chinamen or two to make the tale complete, President Mark Hopkins
    last May dedicated the new chapel at Hampton to the worship of Almighty God. He
    voiced the sentiment of this whole Association when he said, "Here will be taught and
    promoted a Christianity as narrow in its creed as revealed truth, and as broad in its
    love as humanity!" "A creed as narrow as revealed truth." Yes! we want no
    inspirations from outside the sacred book. "A love as broad as humanity." By all
    means, yes! for no smaller measure will satisfy the demands of that book or fulfil
    the will of the Master.</p>
    <h4>III.&mdash;A RADICAL CONSECRATION.</h4>
    <p>Another principle required in this work and exemplified by it, is a thorough-going
    consecration. The men and women who have taken up this work, have followed Christ in
    his self-abnegation. There is no worldly honor in it. It is not an easy life. You
    know well enough how these devoted missionaries have braved social ostracism, and
    shut themselves in to their lowly ministry. With the Christly "sympathy of
    identification," they have made themselves one with their despised brethren, bearing
    their burdens, sharing their privations, stooping to meet their needs. What almost
    infinite patience it has sometimes required, what forbearance and charity, we cannot
    know, but they have served willingly and cheerfully, and found the sacrifice to be a
    joy. And there are many of them, in school and church and home, in our Southern land
    and in the Western wilds, who are serving there in a spirit of self-abnegation and
    patient sacrifice, and whom God will honor. These faithful workers are not martyrs;
    but there is something heroic in their lives. It is the heroism of those who lay upon
    themselves the lowliest duties, and perform them in the spirit of the loftiest
    devotion. The work that calls forth such consecration as this, so disinterested and
    sincere, bears its own letter of commendation. The spirit of Him, who "came to
    minister, and to give his life a ransom for many," is exemplified by it.</p>
    <h4>IV.&mdash;A RADICAL METHOD.</h4>
    <p>There is one thing more that I would mention. It is the radical <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>{161}</span> method which this
    Association has adopted in doing its work. It has never been satisfied with surface
    culture. It strikes down to the roots of character. Not "quantity," but "quality," is
    manifestly its motto. As an illustration of intelligent thoroughness in Christian
    service, therefore, this Association commends itself to our regard.</p>
    <p>A decided advance was marked in missionary work when the church came to see that
    not only the conversion of the heathen, but their establishment in Christian
    character, was a legitimate object of missionary endeavor. Francis Xavier in ten
    years visited fifty kingdoms and baptized a million converts, but the ten years'
    labor of some of our modern missionaries, spent in laying solid foundations and
    thoroughly training a few chosen men, may, after all, come to more in its permanent
    results upon the world, than all that was done by Rome's great apostle. Jesus gave
    the best part of his three years of public ministry to the training of twelve men. He
    might have baptised a million. He preferred to do thorough work with a few. This
    Association has acted upon this principle. It has sought to develop manhood and
    womanhood after the pattern and by the power that is in Jesus Christ. It calls to its
    aid every possible force. It educates the mind, the heart, the conscience, the hand.
    It uses the church, the school, the workshop and the Christian home.
    Character-building is its vocation, the foundation Jesus Christ, the superstructure
    such as should stand the test of fire. These oppressed races need above all things
    else leaders from among themselves. It has been the endeavor of this Society to
    furnish them&mdash;men and women of such moral and mental quality as shall be fitted
    for the responsible position. They have been taught to think, to work and to live.
    Because labor is a moral force in establishing character, industrial education is
    introduced. Nothing is too great to be attempted, nothing too trivial to be omitted,
    the object always being the substantial development of moral and Christian
    character.</p>
    <p>Such is this mission. It has gone forth in the spirit of Christ, with faith and
    love and consecration, seeking to do an honest work with thoroughness. God's blessing
    has been upon it. It has results to show in the renovated and ennobled lives of
    thousands who have been the subjects of its ministry; and its broader influence in
    the elevation of the oppressed and despised races, begins even now to be clearly
    apparent. It has been a faithful monitor to the churches which have sustained it, an
    inspirer of their benevolence, an almoner of their gifts, and an honor to their name.
    And beyond all this, standing for those principles which are most essential and
    fundamental in Christianity, it has glorified God by exhibiting to the world the
    power of Christian faith and sacrifice. Those who have been bound of Satan, lo, these
    many years, are loosed from their bonds and made free in Christ. War has struck off
    the chains of human bondage. Love shall now complete the emancipation.</p>

    <h2>THE SOUTH.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>"NOTES IN THE SADDLE."</h3>
    <p>BY REV. C.J. RYDER, DISTRICT SECRETARY.</p>
    <p>The following, which was taken from the public records of a <i>white</i> school in
    Tennessee, illustrates the intellectual condition of a portion of the white citizens
    of that and the other Southern States. It also shows what kind of men have charge of
    public instruction in some districts throughout the South.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"TENN July &mdash;, 188-.</p>
      <p>"Rulus for scoul No 4.</p>
      <p>Teacher will not low the scoulars to scouful or clime or swhisparn in time of
      Books; the Teacher can ad eney rulus to this he thinks needud and eney Larg secular
      can not comer ounder rulus will have to quit the scoul."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These "rulus," as the word is spelled, were signed by two members of the School
    Board by whom they were written. How strange, that in localities in which there is
    such frightful illiteracy the school authorities should fail to welcome, with
    large-hearted cordiality, teachers who come among them. The white people, as well as
    the colored, need missionary schools, as the illiteracy among them is appalling.</p>
    <p>Think of it! Seven-tenths of one per cent. of the native white population of
    Massachusetts are illiterate, while twenty-three per cent. of the native white
    population of Georgia, and thirty-one per cent. of the same population of North
    Carolina are illiterate!! Why should not Georgia be proud of her educated (?)
    citizens, and do all she dare to drive some of the best teachers there are in the
    State outside her borders?</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Right in this connection it would be interesting to read the following letter. A
    brief word of history, however, is necessary that it may be understood. In 1878, a
    young man, a graduate of one of the leading New England colleges, enlisted in the
    great army of A.M.A. teachers. He was a quiet, unassuming, Christian student. The
    amazing ignorance of the Southern people, both white and black, awoke his pity; and
    his love, for his Saviour, and for his country, led him to give himself to this most
    needy field. He was embarrassed and badgered by those who ought to have welcomed him,
    and helped him in his work. This mean and unworthy opposition with which our A.M.A.
    teachers are so familiar, culminated in his case, in a series of letters in which his
    <i>life</i> was threatened. It was just before the election of President Cleveland.
    There was evidently, a well-matured plan to drive him out of the community, and to
    intimidate the Negroes so that they would not dare to vote. The following was one of
    these letters:</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>{163}</span>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"Mr &mdash;&mdash; deer Sir It is for your own good That I write This letter to
      you you are an advocate for Social Equality with the white and the Black race and
      the People are not going to Put up with any Such doings and I write you this letter
      to warn you of The danger and the great danger That you are in You must leve The
      country right away for The People have Pledged Them Seves to get you out of the
      contry or Kill you and That in a mity Short time Now as a frend I do beg you to
      give this matter your emmediate attention I am very truly your well wisher meaning
      Exactly wat I Say"</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I saw all these letters, and received this one from the hand of this Christian
    hero. He said to me:&mdash;"I went to bed a good many nights thinking that quite
    possibly I should be dragged out of my bed, and beaten or hanged before morning."
    Notwithstanding this, he wrote on the outside of the envelope the following words,
    and passed them around among those whom he knew to be conspirators against him:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"In answer to the enclosed, I will say to my 'Democratic and inquiring friends,'
      that I expect to leave on or before Jan. 1st, 1940, and that though I hoped to vote
      for 'St. John and Prohibition,' I have now decided to vote for 'Blaine and the
      Protection of all citizens in their political and civil rights.'"</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>When he gave me this letter, he took a promise that it should not be published
    until after his death. He passed away in the triumph of his sweet, but heroic faith a
    few months ago. He died where he had suffered and dared for Christ's sake, in the
    midst of this ignorance and sin.</p>
    <p>Such stories as his ought to be told. It is cowardly timidity for those of us who
    know them, to keep them from the Christian public. Heroes and heroines answer to the
    roll-call of A.M.A. workers. I have met them and mingled with them, the past three
    years, and I know the sinew and fibre of their courageous faith. You, who send them
    out, and who support them in the field, ought to know what they endure, and hear, now
    and then, an incident of their heroism.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Two cases of heroic self-denial have come under my notice recently. In Macon there
    lives a colored woman whose husband is in an Insane Asylum. Their home was recently
    burned to the ground. She has four <span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"
    id="page164"></a>{164}</span> small children with her, the eldest of whom is eleven
    years old, who are dependent upon her for support. She earns just eight dollars per
    month, and yet she sends one girl, aged fifteen, to Atlanta University!</p>
    <p>A young man, whose father was a white man and who is himself a blonde, has been
    urgently invited by his white grandmother to come to her home and take the position
    of her son's child. She is a wealthy woman, owning a large plantation. The young
    man's father, her son, is dead. The boy would have all the privileges of a wealthy
    young white man and inherit the property on his grandmother's death. The sole
    condition which the grandmother makes is that he shall give up all association with
    his octoroon mother and refuse to recognize her in any way. Thank God, the boy is too
    true to his gentle and loving mother to enter into any such arrangement, even though
    the bribe offered is thousands of dollars and a social position of great
    attractiveness. There is a great deal of this quiet but heroic self-sacrifice among
    the colored people in the South, that never finds its way into print.</p>
    <hr />
    <a name="south2" id="south2"></a>
    <h3>THE ALABAMA ASSOCIATION.</h3>
    <p>PRESIDENT H.S. DEFOREST.</p>
    <p>The thirteenth annual meeting of the Alabama Association was held at Salma, March
    30th to April 3d, when the floods were at their highest, yet fourteen of our
    seventeen churches were represented. The Sunday-school Association convened a day
    earlier, and one afternoon the Woman's Missionary Association had a session by
    itself.</p>
    <p>The opening sermon by Professor Andrews, was a powerful exposition of Christian
    love, from the 13th of 1st Corinthians. One evening was given to the higher,
    Christian education; one to three papers on "How to Secure Homes," "The Home
    Indoors," and "Home Piety;" and the last to three phases of the temperance question.
    Pastor C.B. Curtis, whose church most generously entertained the Association, read a
    very suggestive paper on "Self Support of the Churches," a pressing and difficult
    question. Almost of necessity, when there is so much to be done, and the resources
    are so small compared with the magnitude of the undertakings, practical rather than
    theoretical questions come to the front and engage earnest attention.</p>
    <p>After a most satisfactory examination, six young men from the Theological
    Department of Talladega College were licensed to preach, and it is noteworthy, that,
    besides this latest gift of Talladega to the ministry, eleven of the fourteen
    churches represented at this meeting of the Association are ministered to by
    Talladega College or its graduates. It is a wonder that some man wishing to put a
    comparatively small sum of money where it would increase with a compound interest of
    blessedness till the latter-day glories have fully come, does not endow the chair of
    Theology at Talladega, and his brothers take up the same line of usefulness till both
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>{165}</span> College and
    Seminary are presided for. Some who were taking the rudiments of learning here but a
    few years ago, and who have continued their training at very email expense, are now
    acceptably filling difficult and responsible positions in school, in business and in
    church. There is more of this work to be done, and to be allowed to help seems a
    privilege precious enough to make life vastly desirable.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>TEMPERANCE WORK IN OUR SCHOOLS.</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Our esteemed neighbor at 58 Reade Street, Mr. J.N. Stearns, Publishing Agent of
      the National Temperance Society, recently made a visit to Florida. On his return
      trip, he visited several of the A.M.A. schools in the South, and his practiced eye
      of course detected the facts in regard to temperance instruction and influence. We
      quote the following items:</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>At Beach Institute, Savannah, under care of the American Missionary Association,
    Miss A.A. Holmes principal, I found 230 pupils and a strong temperance sentiment. The
    entire school receives sound temperance instruction. Stirring temperance songs ring
    through the halls. A Band of Hope holds regular meetings. "Mother Goose and Her
    Temperance Family," was performed with great satisfaction by the pupils, and a
    photograph group of the actors taken and preserved as a memento of the occasion.
    "Alcohol and Hygiene" and the "Catechism on Alcohol" are among the studies.</p>
    <p>At Charleston I found Avery Institute slowly recovering from the effects of the
    earthquake which effectually scattered its students. Over 200, however, were now in
    attendance, under the auspices of the American Missionary Association, with Professor
    M.A. Holmes principal. Temperance is a cardinal virtue here, but they greatly need a
    temperance library and other literature. All these schools have a severe struggle to
    sustain their ordinary work, and must depend largely upon outside help for temperance
    literature. They can use to great advantage and carefully distribute, without
    expense, to the community round about if only the material is furnished.</p>
    <p>At Wilmington, N.C., a great work has been accomplished. It has 20,000
    inhabitants, 12,000 of which are colored. In 1881, when the vote on prohibition was
    taken in the State, it was all against the proposition. A wonderful change for the
    better has taken place. I had a most pleasant visit to Gregory Institute of 250
    pupils, Mr. George A. Woodard principal. This is also under the American Missionary
    Association. "Alcohol and Hygiene" is taught in the higher branches and temperance
    pervades every department. An open temperance society, with Rev. George S. Rollins
    president, holds regular evening meetings, with temperance songs, recitations,
    dialogues, essays and speeches, for entertainment and instruction. The regular
    meeting occurred the evening I was in town, and I greatly enjoyed the exercises.
    Carolina Mills was proposed for <span class="pagenum"><a name="page166"
    id="page166"></a>{166}</span> membership, and a committee of three appointed to
    "investigate and report." The report was "favorable," and read in regular order and
    adopted. The candidate came forward to take the pledge, and proved to be a young man
    of genuine African descent. The entire programme was rendered with great credit to
    all concerned.</p>

    <h2>THE CHINESE.</h2>
    <h3>EVANGELISTIC WORK.</h3>
    <p>It is now nearly five months since our evangelists went forth, and the record of
    their work, if I had both grace and space to give it in graphic detail, could not but
    interest the readers of the MISSIONARY. Chin Toy was to labor in our more northern
    missions, viz., Stockton, Sacramento, Marysville and Oroville, and Loo Quong was to
    go south to Santa Barbara and San Diego and certain other cities where Chinese had
    congregated, but in which there appeared to be none to care for their souls.
    Subsequently another brother entered the field, Yong Jin, laboring first at Santa
    Cruz, and now at Tucson, Arizona.</p>
    <p>The intention was to give one month of service at each mission, and one gratifying
    feature of our experience has been that at no point has this <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page167" id="page167"></a>{167}</span> one month been deemed sufficient. In
    every case an urgent plea has come for a longer visit and a larger work. In some
    cases, as with Chin Toy in Sacramento, and Loo Quong at San Diego, it has been
    necessary to yield to these appeals. The work needed could not be fulfilled in the
    month assigned. But in general we have adhered to the original plan, so as to cover
    the whole field.</p>
    <p>The results have justified the undertaking. The work of these brethren has been
    greatly blessed, first of all, to those who were already believers in Jesus. They
    have been taught the truth more perfectly. They have had their conceptions of a
    Christian's duty and a Christian's privileges raised. They have been brought into
    closer harmony with each other. It is too much to expect, perhaps, in view of facts
    as they transpire in churches of American Christians&mdash;Christians "to the manner
    born"&mdash;that our little groups of Chinese believers born as "aliens from the
    commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise," should be free
    from all envies and jealousies, walking always in brotherly love. We wish it were so,
    but our wish is, as yet, but partially fulfilled. Our evangelists have so presented
    Christ, and so magnified the duty and the blessing of brotherly love, and so
    exercised, also, their gifts of Christian diplomacy, as to become peace-makers, and
    to restore a truly spiritual order at points where chaos seemed impending.</p>
    <p>They have been "in labors abundant." The following from Yong Jin, at Santa Cruz,
    puts in fewest words their ordinary work: "This school has nineteen or twenty
    scholars. About sixteen come to take the lesson every evening. Mrs. Willett teach and
    I teach. [<i>i.e.</i> during the usual school session from 7 till 9 p.m.] After the
    school is out, I teach them the Bible lesson about half so long. [<i>i.e.</i> from
    9.15 till 10.15 p.m.] Monday, Tuesday and Thursday evenings gave them the Bible
    lesson of Chinese. Wednesday and Friday evenings, the Bible lesson of English.
    Saturday evenings we have meeting. Sunday noon, I did preach in the
    street&mdash;three times since I came here." With this is associated constant
    visiting of such Chinese as either cannot or will not attend the school, seeking to
    sow beside all waters. Also study; in some cases aided through the kindness of some
    resident pastor, for these brethren have entered upon this work untrained except in
    the work itself, and one point of greatest moment in their present service is to
    learn how to render better service in the years to come. Street preaching is
    undertaken wherever possible. What a hearing can be secured if only some American
    Christians will cooperate, was well illustrated in the experience of Loo Quong at San
    Diego. I cite the following sentences: "This afternoon we have a grand time in
    preaching the good news of Jesus to the Chinese. There were more than <i>ten</i> good
    people who had gathered there to help me in the singing. After half an hour of hard
    talk, [<i>i.e.</i>, earnest laborious speaking,] then Mr. Kirby, an old gentleman,
    next is Rev. Dr. Harwood, then a stranger.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>{168}</span>
    <p>All these speakings I have put in Chinese and they were listened to by at least a
    thousand Chinese and whites. Among the helpers were Mrs. Noble and Mrs. McKensie and
    the whole family of Rev. Dr. Harwood. Besides these were many other good Christian
    ladies who stood around me and were given willing lips to join the singing. I cannot
    tell you all about our street preaching here. I will leave it for you to think about
    and enjoy. Amen."</p>
    <p>God has used this preaching of the Word, not only to edify the brethren, but to
    bring men to repentance. The numbers may seem small when compared with those reported
    by our American evangelists laboring among the tens of thousands in our great cities,
    but, under the circumstances, they are very cheering. At Stockton, 1; Sacramento, 1;
    San Buenaventura, 3; San Diego, 3; Oakland, 4; San Francisco, 5; Tucson, 5; Santa
    Barbara, 7; Santa Cruz, 11. Total 40. This is the harvest of the past five months. If
    the work of the whole year should yield corresponding returns, it will be the most
    fruitful of our whole history. Much remains unsaid, for which I may find space
    hereafter.</p>
    <p>WM. C. POND.</p>
    <hr />
    <a name="chinese2" id="chinese2"></a>
    <p>The Chinese have been considered by many impervious to Christian influence, but
    the following paragraph shows that by "deeds, not words," the Oriental, sometimes,
    expresses his gratitude. Sometime ago a Chinaman in a Sunday-school was taken ill,
    and, through the influence of its superintendent, admission to a hospital was
    secured, until he was able to return to his native land. But no word of thanks was
    given for the faithful care and unwearied attentions he had received, and only the
    assurance of the Master's approbation cheered the hearts of those who had sowed the
    gospel truth in his name. The weeks went by, when from over the sea came a living
    testimony of the gratitude of this Chinamen in the form of his young son, whom he had
    sent to America with the injunction to find the unforgotten superintendent, and go to
    her Sunday-school. For five months now he has been under her care, and at the recent
    reception given by the Chinese scholars to their teachers, on their New Year, he
    wrote in a clear, well-defined hand, every word correctly spelled, this letter to his
    teacher, who had sent him her regrets that she could not be present.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>My Dear Teacher:</p>
      <p>I thank you for your letter. I am sorry you could not come to the supper last
      Monday night. I am glad you can teach me every Sunday. I like to go to
      Sunday-school. Please write to me again.</p>
      <p>Yours truly&mdash;&mdash;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Five months ago this boy was unable to speak or understand a word of English; now
    he can read, write, and repeat the Lord's Prayer from memory, a task he studied long
    and patiently to accomplish.</p>

    <p>The Woman's Missionary Association of Alabama held its annual meeting in
    connection with the State Association, April 2d, at Selma. The meeting was well
    attended, and encouraging reports were had from many of the auxiliaries. The
    advantage of the local missionary societies to the church and Sunday-school work was
    emphasized, and a desire for more thorough local work was very apparent in the
    meeting. Many subjects of interest were discussed. Among them the following:
    Industrial Training in our Schools; Industrial Training in our Homes; Should there be
    a Woman's Missionary Society in every church? If so, the reason why every sister in
    the church should be a member; What shall we do to make our Local Societies more
    active?</p>
    <p>Greetings of the Second Woman's Temperance Union of Alabama, were presented at
    this meeting. This Union is composed of colored women of various views, together with
    Northern missionaries and teachers. There is no doubt that their work for purity and
    sobriety is most efficient, yet this Union can have no dealings with the other Union,
    though color hinders neither of the vices which the Unions oppose.</p>

    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>{170}</span>
    <p><i>Special Subject for Prayer</i>.&mdash;That obstacles in the way of the speedy
    coming of Christ be removed.</p>
    <p><i>First Topic</i>.&mdash;When, Where and How did this Society originate? (See

    <p><i>Second Topic</i>.&mdash;What are some of the results and a general summary of
    the work done in forty-six years? (See same papers, and also "Pamphlet No.
    10&mdash;Forty Years of Missionary Work, Past and Present.")</p>
    <p><i>Third Topic</i>.&mdash;What are the four grand divisions of its work, and where
    are its various fields of operations? (See same papers.)</p>
    <p><i>Fourth Topic</i>.&mdash;When was the Bureau of Woman's Work organized, and what
    is its special department? (See "Forty Years of Missionary Labor," page 17; also,
    Leaflet "Bureau of Woman's Work," "Freed Women of the South," and "Sewing

    <p>The ladies in the North who are engaged in every good work for the Lord will be
    glad to find that there are those in the South who share their burdens, and their
    faith, also. The letter below was written by one of our most intelligent and earnest
    Christian workers&mdash;a colored lady educated in one of our schools.</p>
    <p>"Our usual lines of work have gone on with about the same results, except among
    the women. Our Woman's Prayer Meeting shows unusual fervor, and we are expecting to
    make this meeting <i>felt</i> in the community and church. Satan seems on the
    war-path, and we women feel that we must be wide-awake and closer to the Lord, if the
    power of evil is to be checked. In our last meeting the one feeling each expressed
    was: 'What can <i>I</i> do? I feel that I am called to work for the Master, but
    <i>what</i> can I do for Christ?' In the struggle for bread, the time of many of the
    women is used all the day; then the house must be cared for, and when this is done,
    strength fails. I tried to impress the thought that much is gained when a soul is
    anxious to work for the Lord, and that such a soul will not be left unguided, which
    seemed to comfort many a tired mother.</p>
    <p>"<i>My</i> difficulty is different. I am perplexed to know which of the many
    phases of Christian work to adopt for these women, and how to keep up interest and
    attendance without multiplying meetings. I am confident that our regular four weekly
    meetings and the regular monthly meetings are all they can attend, yet they
    <i>need</i> others. I am often reminded of my dear mother's prayer which she used to
    cry out when greatly tried in the days of slavery: 'Oh! for Job's patience and
    Joshua's resolution, that we might all pull together like Pharaoh's horses.' And I
    would add: 'Oh! for Solomon's wisdom and Samson's strength, that we might understand
    and do the Lord's work.'"</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:
